# Module 11 Challenge - UFOs

The purpose of this challenge is to extend the filtering capabilities on the previously built webpage with dynamic tables (able to filter on one parameter only - date), to now allow the user to filter the data set utilizing a maximum of five parameters - date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Challenge Overview

The goals of this challenge are to:

- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.
- Provide recommendation for further development
